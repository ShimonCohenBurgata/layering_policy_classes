# layering_policy_classes
A while back, a good friend and colleague shared a presentation with me called 'I Didn't Know Constraints Could Do That' by John Dickol. When I first read it, I didn't understand nothing (also after second read) However, the code provided and its structure caught my attention. After reading it more thoroughly, I concluded that the most effective approach to enhance my understanding would be to create my own example using terms from my area of expertise, which is power management.

Following are resources I used for building my example:
1. [ten thousand failures blog post ](https://tenthousandfailures.com/blog/2015/3/15/systemverilog-constraint-layering-examples-from-john-dickol)
2. [John Dickol youtube presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcfChOLSEeM&ab_channel=MikeBartley)
3. [SystemVerilog Constraint Layering via Reusable Randomization Policy Classes](https://dvcon-proceedings.org/wp-content/uploads/systemverilog-constraint-layering-via-reusable-randomization-policy-classes.pdf)
If you find this subject intriguing and wish to gain a deeper understanding of this experiment, it is strongly recommended that you engage with John's presentation and paper.
John's explanations regarding this subject are outstanding.
